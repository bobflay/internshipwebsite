    <h1>Xpertbot Academy App Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the Xpertbot Academy App. By using our App, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-heading">1. Information We Collect</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">1.1. Face Data</div>
    <p>During the test-taking process, our App may collect photos of your face. The face data collected includes images of your face and may also include facial features and expressions captured during the test. This face data is collected for the sole purpose of analyzing and detecting any signs of cheating during the examination.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">2. Use of Collected Information</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">2.1. Face Data Usage</div>
    <p>The collected face data is used exclusively for the purpose of analyzing and detecting cheating behavior during the test. We utilize our proprietary Xpertbot tool, which employs facial recognition and detection algorithms, to analyze the face data. This analysis helps us ensure the integrity and fairness of the examination process.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">3. Sharing of Information</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">3.1. Third-Party Sharing</div>
    <p>We do not share the collected face data with any third parties outside of Xpertbot servers. Your face data is securely stored on our servers and is accessible only to authorized personnel who are bound by strict confidentiality obligations.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">4. Data Retention and Deletion</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">4.1. Retention Period</div>
    <p>The face data collected during the test will be retained on our servers for a maximum of 48 hours. This retention period allows us to complete the analysis process thoroughly. After 48 hours, the face data will be permanently deleted from our servers to ensure the privacy and security of our users.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">5. Data Security</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">5.1. Security Measures</div>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption, firewalls, access controls, and secure server infrastructure. However, please note that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">6. Children's Privacy</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">6.1. Minors</div>
    <p>Our App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a minor without parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our servers.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">7.1. Updates</div>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes we make will be posted within the App, and the revised Privacy Policy will have an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we collect, use, disclose, share, and retain your information.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">8. Contact Us</div>
    <div class="section-subheading">8.1. Questions or Concerns</div>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of your personal information, please contact us at [contact email address].</p>
